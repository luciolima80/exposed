      <p>Hello<br/>

I think it is time for Dorota’s friends and colleagues know also my version of the story I had with her. <br/>

For sure you already know her version, so I kindly invite you to know mine:  This will be, let’s say…a reposition of truth… <br/>

I will tell my version in a form of a warning to the men that are eventualy thinking in dating Dorota  Szydelkiewicz…Let’s say it is male solidarity. <br/>

If you consider having a relationship with Dorota Szydelkiewicz that goes beyond the professional (being her lover, her boyfriend or simply to date her) there are some things you should know first … 

First of all, you should be ready to give her total freedom…including to meet other men…even if she assumes a serious relationship with you.<br/> 

If this is OK for you and you are not selfish and you like to share, this should not be a problem for you. As we say in my country, (pussy) when washed 
and dryed it is like new. <br/></p>

   <p>
   Of course, in the end, even after confessing, the problem is always yours, and you have emotional issues, lack of self-confidence, <br/>
     you are unable to control your emotions and so on…<br/>I do not know if this woman should be a psychiatrist or to visit one… <br/>

I do not know how Polish men reacts, but when a man of my country hears something like this from his girlfriend , things can become very, very complicated…
