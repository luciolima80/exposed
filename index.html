      <p>Hello<br/>

I think it is time for Dorota’s friends and colleagues know also my version of the story I had with her. <br/>

For sure you already know her version, so I kindly invite you to know mine:  This will be, let’s say…a reposition of truth… <br/>

I will tell my version in a form of a warning to the men that are eventualy thinking in dating Dorota  Szydelkiewicz…Let’s say it is male solidarity. <br/>

If you consider having a relationship with Dorota Szydelkiewicz that goes beyond the professional (being her lover, her boyfriend or simply to date her) there are some things you should know first … 

<br/>First of all, you should be ready to give her total freedom…including to meet other men…even if she assumes a serious relationship with you.<br/> 

If this is OK for you and you are not selfish and you like to share, this should not be a problem for you. As we say in my country, (pussy) when washed 
and dryed it is like new. <br/></p>

   <p>
   Of course, in the end, even after confessing, the problem is always yours, and you have emotional issues, lack of self-confidence, <br/>
     you are unable to control your emotions and so on…<br/>I do not know if this woman should be a psychiatrist or to visit one… <br/>

I do not know how Polish men reacts, but when a man of my country hears something like this from his girlfriend , things can become very, very complicated…

   <p>
   One more thing :you should have money enough to sponsor her. <br/>She likes confort, especially the confort others pay for.<br>
     Yes, for sure you will see a padron where is always you to pay the dinners you have with her, the breakfasts after crazy nights of sex,<br/>
     and in general every single time you go out. <br/>You will see in the time of pay in restaurants, Dorota Szydelkiewicz never pushes the CC to split the bill<br/>
     and looks to the payment terminal like the devil looks to a cross. <br/>
     But do not worry, if you have no money enough, she will let you know when she brokes up with you (normally through whatsapp or FB messenger), <br/>
     two days after ask you how much money you earn per month …

   <p>
   But even after this small warning,you get involved with Dorota Szydelkiewicz, let me tell you how the things will happen: First of all, for sure you will meet <br/>
     her on FB dating groups, or Tinder. On Tinder you can recognize her by this photo:
        <center><img src = "e.jpg" width="300px" height="349px" /></center>
   <p>
   When you meet her in real life you will see there is a lot of photoshop there… In fact, she will be more like this “sack of potatoes” below…
