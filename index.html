        Hello<br />

I think it is time for Dorota’s friends and colleagues know also my version of the story I had with her. 

For sure you already know her version, so I kindly invite you to know mine:  This will be, let’s say…a reposition of truth… 

I will tell my version in a form of a warning to the men that are eventualy thinking in dating Dorota  Szydelkiewicz…. 

Let’s say it is male solidarity. 

If you consider having a relationship with Dorota Szydelkiewicz that goes beyond the professional (being her lover, her boyfriend or simply to date her) there are some things you should know first … 

First of all, you should be ready to give her total freedom…including to meet other men…even if she assumes a serious relationship with you. 

If this is OK for you and you are not selfish and you like to share, this should not be a problem for you. As we say in my country, (pussy) when washed and dryed it is like new.
